## Project: Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Bike Rentals

### Steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use a publicly available dataset like the [Capital Bikeshare Dataset](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) or the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).
   - Supplement the dataset with weather data from sources like NOAA or OpenWeather (e.g., daily temperature, precipitation).

2. **Data Cleaning** (Google Sheets/SQL):
   - Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Merge the bike rental data with weather data using shared attributes (e.g., date).

3. **Data Analysis** (SQL/Python):
   - Write SQL queries to explore trends (e.g., rentals by hour, day, or season).
   - Use Python to conduct further statistical analysis, such as correlation between temperature and rentals.

4. **Data Visualization** (Python/Google Sheets):
   - Create charts in Python using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn (e.g., a line graph of rentals over time or a scatter plot of rentals vs. temperature).
   - Highlight key trends in Google Sheets with pivot tables or additional graphs.

5. **Presentation** (Google Slides):
   - Summarize the problem, methods, and key findings in a visually engaging presentation.
   - Include visualizations and actionable insights (e.g., recommend optimal staffing during peak times or suggest rental promotions during specific weather conditions).
